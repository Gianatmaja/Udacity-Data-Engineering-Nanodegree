# Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree
This repository contains the projects I completed in the Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree.

### Project 1: Data Modelling with Postgres
In this project, we'll be creating a database schema and building an ETL pipeline using Python and SQL. The ETL pipeline will then be used to transfer data from json logs in local directories into tables in Postgres.

### Project 2: Data Modelling with Apache Cassandra
In this project, we'll be modelling data using Apache Cassandra and building an ETL pipeline using Python. The ETL pipeline will transfer data from a set of csv files within a directory into Apache Cassandra tables.
