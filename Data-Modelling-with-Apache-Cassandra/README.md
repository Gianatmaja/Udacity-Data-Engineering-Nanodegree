# Project 2: Data Modelling with Apache Cassandra
This project is part of the Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree program.

### Background
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

### Objective
In this project, the objective is to create a Apache Cassandra database with tables to perform queries on song play analysis. To achieve this, we will perform ETL on local csv files and transfer them to Apache Cassandra tables, with data models according to the queries required.
